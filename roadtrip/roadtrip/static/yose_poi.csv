436米（1,430英尺）高的上优胜美地瀑布（又称“大优胜美地瀑布”），这一段瀑布独自的高度已可列入全世界20个最高瀑布当中，有数条从优胜美地谷地，或是外部山区的登山步道可达此瀑布的顶端或底部，主要的水源来自鹰溪平原（Eagle Creek Meadow）支流：优胜美地溪（Yosemite Creek），多个水道在此汇集，并自峭壁顶端猛烈冲击而下，造成了上优胜美地瀑布。
在上下两瀑布之间的落差区，有几个小潭，一般称此区为湍流区（the cataracts）。这一区的高度有675呎，差不多是下优胜美地瀑布的两倍高度，因为地理上的外观阻碍，这一块区域不容易全部看到，入口也很难被发现，最佳的观看角度是在往上优胜美地瀑布的步道上自己寻找可见的角度。国家公园对此区亦有特别警告，对喜好攀岩者，此区的风险必须自负，如需搜救行动，因地形难达，所以花费甚多。
下优胜美地瀑布（也称小优胜美地瀑布）高有320英尺（98米），有相当容易的步道可达（轮椅亦可），因此往往是游客最多的地方，优胜美地溪到此往默塞德河流去，如同该山区的其他溪流，优胜美地溪在这里产生了许多激流和乱流，整个地形也相当潮湿与湿滑。
在降雪量比较少的年份，优胜美地瀑布在夏末或秋初就因水量减少而逐渐消失，此时往往有攀岩者趁机挑战从岩面攀登而上，此举在突如其来的午后雷阵雨中，是相当冒险的，瀑布可能突然出现，水量足以将攀岩者冲落。
下优胜美地瀑布可从优胜美地旅馆旁的步道到达，上优胜美地瀑布则需由向阳营地Sunnyside Campground的入口进入，此步道相当陡峭、险峻、不少路段亦相当粗糙、容易滑倒，来回行程长度是6.4英里（10.3千米），落差达2,700英尺（820米），预计来回行程要花6～8小时。其他通往上优胜美地的步道，主要是由北方的Tioga Road前来。",10,8,"37.755018, -119.597297",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_Falls,,景点,徒步,,,

Although the oldest giant sequoias may exceed 3,000 years in age, some living specimens of the ancient bristlecone pine (found in the mountains east of Yosemite and at Great Basin National Park in Nevada, among other places) are more than 4,600 years old. The tallest trees are the giant sequoia's cousin—the coast redwood, which you can see at Muir Woods National Monument and Redwood National Park, among others. 

To get there: The two-mile Mariposa Grove Road is open from approximately April through November. When open, you can drive to the grove from Yosemite's South Entrance (off of Highway 41). During summer, however, the small parking lot fills frequently, resulting in periodic road closures. So, it's best to take the free Wawona-Mariposa Grove shuttle.

The lake is a popular destination for cross-country skiers during the winter. It is the primary source of Bridalveil Creek, which feeds Bridalveil Falls.

The hike to Ostrander Lake is a long and strenuous 12.7 miles (20.4 km) roundtrip hike starting from the trailhead located just after Bridalveil Creek on the Glacier Point road.[2] The hike begins with a fairly level path through an extensive burned over and regrowth area, with both shaded and sunny areas. The second half of the hike climbs, steeply at times, over 1,500 feet (460 m) in elevation in about 3 miles. Hikers will have a nice view of Clark Range before dropping down to the north shore of the lake. Several excellent campsites can be found on the west side of the lake, particularly on the benches overlooking the rocky ridge that forms the eastern shore backdrop. Fishing is fair for 10-12"" rainbow trout. 

In the summer, the lake is a great backpacking destination because the ski hut is unoccupied but its presence keeps away the hordes of hikers looking for a ""wilderness"" destination. The lake is named for a descendant of Alexander Ostrander (1783) of Smithfield NY. This branch of Ostrander family settled in Colorado (Georgetown, Granby, Hot Sulphur Springs, Golden) prior to 1872, and some moved from Colorado to California.",10,7,"37.624444, -119.550556",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrander_Lake,,景点,徒步,,,
